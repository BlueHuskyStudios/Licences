# Licenses #

A collection of licences used by Blue Husky Studios. Those written by Blue Husky Studios (BH-0-PD, BH-1-PS, and BH-2-PC), are available under the terms of BH-1-PS.

As of right now, all BH licenses are designed to allow the product to be open and modifyable, such as open-source software, or artwork whose source files are redistributed.



## [BH-0-PD](./Licenses/BH-0-PD.txt) ##
> Blue Husky License 0 - **PUBLIC DOMAIN**

This license is intended to allow any products published under it to be placed in the public domain. It is similar to [the MIT license](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License), but with the following notable differences:

-   Legal definitions are explicitly listed
-   It can be applied to more than just software (for instance, artistic works)
-   It does not allow the creator to retroactively remove the product from the public domain without making changes to it



## [BH-1-PS](./Licenses/BH-1-PS.txt) ##
> Blue Husky License 1 - **PUBLIC SHARE**

This license is intended to maintain the rights of the creator to any copies of the product, as well as allow others to freely redistribute it and even modify it, provided they give proper attribution to the original creator. **This license requires that the product be offered for free!** To charge for the product, use BH-2-PC.

This is similar to [CC-BY-SA 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/), but with the following notable differences:

-   It can be applied to more than just artistic works (for instance, software)
-   It allows for inclusion of others' intellectual property under Free Use
-   It clearly separates the roles of the creator(s) and the consumer(s)



## [BH-2-PC](./Licenses/BH-2-PC.txt) ##
> Blue Husky License 2 - **PUBLIC COMMERCIAL**

This license is similar to BH-1-PS, but it allows for the product to be sold commercially, and adds provisions to allow for this, while preventing consumers from doing harm to the creator by abusing the public nature of the product, all while still allowing them to become licensors by paying for it.

This license was designed to be compliant with [Apple's Minimum Terms of Developer&lsquo;s EULA](https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/dev/minterms/), allowing it to be used as an EULA on Apple's app stores.



# Opus Numbers #

When a license's text is changed in any meaningful way (that is to say, not including small changes like spacing, typographical error correction, etc.), its Opus number is incremented. That number is always displayed at the top of the license, alongside the license's title, and is always an integer.

A license with the opus number of **0** indicates that that license is still being drafted and should not yet be used.
