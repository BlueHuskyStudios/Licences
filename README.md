# Licenses #

This repository is a collection of licenses used by Blue Husky Studios. Those written by Blue Husky Studios (BH-0-PD, BH-1-PS, and BH-2-PC), are available under the terms of BH-1-PS.

As of right now, all BH licenses are designed to allow the product to be open and modifyable, such as open-source software, or artwork whose source files are redistributed.



## [BH-0-PD](./Licenses/BH-0-PD.txt) ##
> Blue Husky License 0 - **PUBLIC DOMAIN**

This license is intended to allow any products published under it to be placed in the public domain. It is similar to [the MIT license](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License), but with the following notable differences:

-   Legal definitions are explicitly listed
-   It can be applied to more than just software (for instance, artistic works)
-   It does not allow the creator to retroactively remove the product from the public domain without making changes to it



## [BH-1-PS](./Licenses/BH-1-PS.txt) ##
> Blue Husky License 1 - **PUBLIC SHARE**

This license is intended to make sure that the creator keeps ownership of the product, as well as to allow others to freely redistribute it and even modify it, provided they give proper attribution to the original creator. **This license requires that the product be offered for free!** To charge for the product, use BH-2-PC.

This is similar to [CC-BY-SA 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/), but with the following notable differences:

-   It can be applied to more than just artistic works (for instance, software)
-   It allows for inclusion of others' intellectual property under Free Use
-   It allows itself to be included in others' intellectual property without restricting either
-   It clearly separates the roles of the creator(s) and the consumer(s)


### Here's what it means in plain English ###

If you made the product (the thing you're distributing this license with):

1. This is your product and you can do what you want with it
    1. You must make sure that if you use anyone else's stuff in it, you do so with their permission, or under Fair Use
    2. If you do include someone else's stuff, you can't claim you made that
    3. You guarantee you're providing this product for free
2. You must let others do what they want with it
    1. They still have to say you made it in the first place
    2. You have to include this license along with your product for it to count
    3. They have to include this license when they redistribute your product
    4. They can't just sell your product - they have to modify it, or use it in their own instead
3. This license is overridden by laws
4. You're not responsible for bad things that might happen because someone used your product


If you got the product (the thing this license came with):

1. This is not your product, and you need to respect that
    1. If you see anyone else's stuff in it, that was put there with their permission, or under Fair Use
    2. You are guaranteed you're getting this product for free
2. You can do what you want with this
    1. You still have to say who made it in the first place
    2. You get all the freedoms in this license along with this product
    3. You have to include this license when you redistribute this product, unless the creator says otherwise
    4. You can edit this license as long as you let other editors know, especially the original author
    5. You must make sure that if you use anyone else's stuff in it, you do so with their permission, or under Fair Use
    6. If you do include someone else's stuff, you can't claim you made that
    7. You can use this to make and sell your own stuff, but you can't just sell this
3. This license is overridden by laws
4. The original creator is not responsible for bad things that might happen because you used this product



## [BH-2-PC](./Licenses/BH-2-PC.txt) ##
> Blue Husky License 2 - **PUBLIC COMMERCIAL**

This license is similar to BH-1-PS, but it allows for the product to be sold commercially, and adds provisions to allow for this, while preventing consumers from doing harm to the creator by abusing the public nature of the product, all while still allowing them to become licensors by paying for it.

This license was designed to be compliant with [Apple's Minimum Terms of Developer&lsquo;s EULA](https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/dev/minterms/), allowing it to be used as an EULA on Apple's app stores.



# Opus Numbers #

When a license's text is changed in any meaningful way (that is to say, not including small changes like spacing, typographical error correction, etc.), its Opus number is incremented. That number is always displayed at the top of the license, alongside the license's title, and is always an integer.

A license with the opus number of **0** indicates that the license is still being drafted and should not yet be used.
